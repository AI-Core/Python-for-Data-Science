    "__Loan default prediction__ is one of the most critical and crucial problems faced by financial institutions and organizations as it has a noteworthy effect on the profitability of these institutions. In recent years, there is a tremendous increase in the volume of _non–performing_ loans which results in a jeopardizing effect on the growth of these institutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to maintain a healthy portfolio, banks put stringent monitoring and evaluation measures in place to ensure the timely repayment of loans by borrowers. Despite these measures, a major proportion of loans become delinquent. _Delinquency_ occurs when a borrower misses a payment against his/her loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the information like mortgage details, borrowers-related details, and payment details, your objective is to build a system that can predict the defaulter status of loans for the next month given the defaulter status for the previous 12 months (in the number of months).\n",

    "## Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "*Feature scaling* is the process of making all features on the same order of magnitude, rather than having some that are 1000x larger than others, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling is one of the most important data preprocessing step in machine learning. Algorithms that compute the distance between the features are biased significantly by numerically larger values if the data is not scaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree-based algorithms are fairly insensitive to the scale of the features. Also, feature scaling helps machine learning models trained using gradient based optimisation (including deep learning algorithms) converge and converge faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization and standardization are the most popular scaling techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalisation, also known as min-max scaling, is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "# $X_{new} = \\frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This scales the range to [0, 1]. Geometrically speaking, transformation squishes the n-dimensional data into an n-dimensional unit hypercube.\n",
    "Normalization is useful when there are no outliers, as it cannot cope with them.\n",
    "Usually, we would scale age and not incomes because only a few people have high incomes but the age is close to uniform\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standardisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardisation, also known as Z-Score Normalization, is the transformation of features by subtracting the mean of the data and dividing by its standard deviation.\n",
    "The resulting value for each feature is often called a Z-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "# $X_{new} = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization can be helpful in cases where the data follows a Gaussian distribution. \n",
    "However, this does not have to be necessarily true. \n",
    "Geometrically speaking, it translates the data to centre it around its original mean and squishes or expands the points around that mean so that it has a unit standard deviation in every direction.\n",
    "We are just changing mean and standard deviation to those of a normal distribution, thus the shape of the original distribution is not affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardisation can handle outliers because the range of the new data is not completely determined by the max and min values.\n"
